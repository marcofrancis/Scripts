# Set the keyboard backlight brightness for the ASUS Zenbook Duo keyboard when
# it is connected via USB (docked).

# This script sends a low-level USB HID "Feature Report" command to the keyboard
# to control its backlight. It's a hybrid script that uses a Bash wrapper to
# execute an embedded Python script.
#
# The Python portion handles the USB communication and requires the 'pyusb'
# library, which it will attempt to install automatically if it's missing.
#
# Usage:
#   ./duo-usb-brightness.sh [level]
#   level: A number from 0 (off) to 3 (maximum brightness). Defaults to 3.
#

# Stop on first error, undefined variable, or pipe failure
set -euo pipefail

# --- Argument Parsing ---

# Read the brightness level from the first command-line argument. Default to 3 (max).
LEVEL="${1:-3}"
# Validate that the level is a single digit from 0 to 3.

# --- Python Interpreter Selection ---

# Prefer using the Python executable from the 'hhd' virtual environment if it
# exists, as it's likely to have the necessary dependencies. Otherwise, fall
# back to the system's default 'python3'.
